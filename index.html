												<br>
												My name is Philipp Schofield, I am from Germany and 25 years old.
												I graduated with a Master's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science.
												
			
												I have been programming for over 10 years now.
												
												One of my main strengths is the ability to tackle difficult and complex
												problems. Whenever I am dealing with a problem I want a solution for, I am
												determined to keep going until I have sufficiently solved it.
												It isn't seldom that when facing such a problem,
												I scribble down my ideas throughout the days
												and think about whether they'll work out or not.

											Due to my mathematics background i have a keen eye for detail when problem solving.
											I am able to dissect a problem, however complex it might be,
											into smaller pieces and solve it step by step in an efficient and effective manner.
											Complex problems can be very frustrating but my background has taught me the courage to tackle
											and the patience to solve such problems.

											I have been exposed to programming for over 10 years now, which has given me a lot of experience.
											I have worked with many different programming languages such as, but not limited to, 
											<b>C++</b>, <b>Java</b> and <b>C#</b>. During my studies in mathematics, I additionally studied
											Computer Science which supplies me with a solid theoretical and practical background.

											During my studies I have found a passion for game development.
											I have made a handful of game projects in Unity Engine together with small teams and
											have been experimenting with the engine ever since.
											In the process of making a particular game I was facing a problem where I wanted a playable spider to move more realistically
											which lead to me building a procedurally animated spider from scratch. This project is featured below.
											For this I had to do a lot of research, e.g. in inverse kinematics.
											And after a lot of different design approaches, I ultimately found a system I was satisfied with.
											For more details, check the project out below.

									<a href="https://github.com/PhilS94/Unity-Procedural-IK-Wall-Walking-Spider" class="image main"><img src="images/Project_SpiderIK_Preview.jpg" alt="" /></a>

									<p>A Unity Engine project in which a controllable wall-walking spider uses inverse kinematics (IK)
										to position its legs to its surroundings in a smart fashion, such that it moves realistically.
										The user can freely control the spider, which is able to walk on any surface: Walls, corners, ceilings, ... you name it!
										While moving, the legs dynamically position themselves to the surroundings without the use of any animations,
										that is all the movement is procedural.</p>

										<p> A QR-Code Scanner written in C++ using the OpenCV library.

										Moreover, it can generate a synthetic dataset of QR-Code images, which can then be used to test the detection.</p>
